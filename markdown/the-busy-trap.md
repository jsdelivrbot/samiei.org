# The Busy Trap
#### Posted September 3, 2013

Finally I completed my military status done. It felt like a great time to change other parts of my life, and I have been decided about simplifying my life recently.

I've always been a yes guy and that lead me to being meaninglessly busy with things I didn't actually care about.

Whenever my mind would wander it would toss around a big to-do list. All the damn time. It's hard to relax when you keep thinking about things you need to be doing instead of relaxing.

In all weekends I was reading more than one hundred feeds. I even prided myself on my unwavering workaholic tendencies. I had to open 10 tabs of articles to read or stash them away for later. Yet another task to complete. I had a revelation one day when I realized I didn't have to read everything I found on the Internet. And you know what? My life didn't end because I missed that article in weekend.

## Simplify.

I say no more often and now I actually have weekends to myself to do things I want to do. I removed apps I didn't use daily from my phone's home screen and deleted ones I didn't use at least once a week. I stopped checking social networks 10 times a day. I got into a regular workout routine.
I've pushed everything else out of the way so I can focus on what I'm doing right now, living life.
