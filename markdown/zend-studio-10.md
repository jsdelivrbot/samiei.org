I'm in love with [Sublimetext](http://sublimetext.com/) for small projects but in last two mouth I used [ZendStudio 10.1](http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/features) and I came to the conclusion that [Zend Studio 10](http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/features) is awesome because:

**Pros:**

- Based on Eclipse <3
- Cross platform. Linux, MacOSX, MS-Windows.
- Very intelligent auto complete.
- Magically can figure out your code concepts and structure. seems that it know more than us about design patterns !
- Debug friendly +profiler. support both XDebug and Zend Debug. Even with dedicate Debug perspective. complete debug solution.
- PHPUnit friendly. code generation, reports and more.
- Builtin Git and Svn functionality. integrated with Github.
- Cloud support.
- Database wizards.
- Terminal, SSH & SFTP support.
- HTML, CSS & Javascript does not bother you anymore.
- **Mobile apps.** [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) and Mobile emulator.
- And everything IDEs have. Emmet, refactoring, bookmakrs, snippets and more..

**Cons :**

- Not free. $150
