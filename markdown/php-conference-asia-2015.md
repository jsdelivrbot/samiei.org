# PHP Conference Asia 2015
#### Posted September 25, 2015

It seems I was not the only one which visit Singapore for the first time, [PHP Conf](http://phpconf.asia/) also was. I just joined [PHP Conf Asia](http://phpconf.asia/) which was the first official PHP Conf along all local user groups events.

The keynote speaker was [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf), he also shares some information about PHP7. I'm already following all updates about PHP7 but hearing [those things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4rRWKygq0) from Rasmus was so exciting.
I liked few talks more than others like: 
- Performance testing for modern apps by [@dustinwhittle](https://twitter.com/dustinwhittle)
- PHP7 & HHVM by [@pierrejoye](https://twitter.com/pierrejoye)
- Extremely defensive PHP by [@ocramius](https://twitter.com/ocramius) 
- Wordpress Security by [@stephboisvert](https://twitter.com/stephboisvert)
- PHP with React [@jacklenox](https://twitter.com/jacklenox)
- Automation changes conversation by [@developerjack](https://twitter.com/developerjack)
- Application security by [@bendechrai](https://twitter.com/bendechrai)

Although all was good.
